# Telco Customer Churn Prediction
 
Telco Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard


üìã Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecommunications company using Power BI. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and visualize the insights through an interactive dashboard. The dataset (telco_cleaned_for_viz) contains customer information such as contract type, monthly charges, tenure, internet service type, payment method, and churn status.

The project follows a structured approach:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Using Python (Jupyter Notebook) to clean and preprocess the raw data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing patterns and correlations in the data.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features like InternetService_Type and PaymentMethod_Type using DAX in Power BI.
Visualization: Building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to present insights.
Reporting: Summarizing findings in a report with actionable recommendations.
üìä Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard (telco_churn_dashboard.pbix) includes the following visualizations:

Overall Churn Rate: Displays the overall churn rate (26.54%).
Churn Count by Contract Type: A stacked column chart showing the total number of churned customers by contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
Monthly Charges Distribution by Churn: A histogram showing the distribution of monthly charges for churned and non-churned customers.
Tenure Distribution by Churn: A histogram showing the distribution of tenure (in months) for churned and non-churned customers.
Churn Count by Internet Service Type: A pie chart showing the number of churned customers by internet service type (Fiber optic, DSL, No Internet).
Churn Count by Payment Method: A stacked column chart showing the number of churned customers by payment method (Electronic check, Credit card, Mailed check, Bank transfer).
Filters (Slicers): Interactive filters for contract_type and InternetService_Type to dynamically explore the data.
üìà Key Insights
Overall Churn Rate: 26.54% of customers have churned.
Contract Type: Customers with a "Month-to-month" contract have the highest churn count, while those with a "Two year" contract have the lowest.
Monthly Charges: Churned customers tend to have higher monthly charges, with a noticeable peak around $70-$100.
Tenure: Customers with shorter tenure (less than 10 months) are more likely to churn.
Internet Service Type: Customers using "Fiber optic" have a higher churn count compared to "DSL" or "No Internet".
Payment Method: Customers paying via "Electronic check" have the highest churn count, while those using "Bank transfer (automatic)" have the lowest.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard (telco_churn_dashboard.pbix).
Python: For data cleaning and preprocessing (Jupyter Notebook).
DAX: For feature engineering in Power BI (e.g., InternetService_Type, PaymentMethod_Type).
Power Query: For data transformation and binning (e.g., monthly charges and tenure histograms).
