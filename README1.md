# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## 📖 Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to identify key factors driving churn and propose strategies to reduce it. The dataset used is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle.

## 📊 Tools Used
- **Python & Pandas**: Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **SQL**: Querying data to identify churn patterns.
- **Power BI / Tableau**: Visualizing churn trends and key metrics.
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration and simple statistics.

## 🔍 Analysis Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and cleaned the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Calculated overall churn rate.
   - Analyzed churn by contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Created a dashboard in Power BI/Tableau to visualize churn trends.
   - Used Python (Seaborn) for additional visualizations.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Customers with high monthly charges (> $80) have a 40% churn rate.
   - Month-to-month contract customers are 3x more likely to churn than those with longer contracts.
   - Recommendations: Offer discounts to high-charge customers and incentivize longer contracts.

## 📈 Results
- **Dashboard**: [View Dashboard Screenshot](link-to-screenshot)
- **Key Insight**: High monthly charges and short-term contracts are the main drivers of churn.
- **Strategy**: Implement discounts and promote long-term contracts to reduce churn.
